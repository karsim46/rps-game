    <h1>WELCOME TO ROCK PAPER SCISSORS!</h1>
    <article>
        The winner of the turn is determined by the following; 
        Rock beats Scissors (rock blunts scissors); Scissors beats Paper 
        (scissors cuts paper); Paper beats Rock (paper covers rock).
         If both players present the same gesture, the turn is a draw and repeated.
